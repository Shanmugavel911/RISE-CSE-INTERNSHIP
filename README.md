# 🔐 Password Strength Checker (My Project)

This is a Python project I built to help people check how strong their passwords are. It also gives tips to make weak passwords stronger and even lets you generate a good one if you're stuck.

---

## 💡 What It Does

- Tells you if a password is **Strong**, **Moderate**, or **Weak**
- Shows what’s good or bad about the password
- Gives clear suggestions on how to improve it
- Has a button to generate strong, random passwords
- Simple and clean interface made using Tkinter

---

## 🚀 How To Run It

### Requirements:
- Python 3.6 or higher
- No need to install extra libraries (just built-in ones like `tkinter`, `re`, etc.)

### Steps:
1. Download the file `password_strength_checker.py`
2. Open a terminal or command prompt
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python password_strength_checker.py
